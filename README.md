# Personal comments by Andres Consalvo:
## Explanation for my lack of commits:
Firstly, we mainly worked doing pair programming so most of the code was written and research in group. The main issue I found when trying to push code to the github repo was an Autherization issue that we couldn't solve. Our solution for this was me sending the code to my teammates os that they could commit and push it. In the document there is a screenshot of the error I encountered in the command line.
